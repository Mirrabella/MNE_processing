# MNE_processing/finding_extrems

- Compare_two_function_ploting_topomaps_with_extrems.ipynb - Compare two function, which ploting topomaps with min and max value of signal. Var 1. first, we average data between subjects, then we look for extrems; Var. 2 first, we look for extrems for each subjects, then we average obtained extrems values. In the end, we make the table with sensor name, times and values of signan on each sensor


- Extract_data_from_Evoked_find_max_min.ipynb - the Var.1 one from Compare_two_function_ploting_topomaps_with_extrems.ipynb is considered in more details
